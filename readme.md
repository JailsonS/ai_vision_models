# Test Cases


To evaluate the best model performance we test different hyperparams for each model. First, channels against other params were tested following the below arrangments:

## Model 1
- channels: [NDFI] both t0 and t1

## Model 2
- channels: [R, G, B, NIR, SWIR1] both t0 and t1

## Model 3
- channels: [SOIL, GV, GVS, NPV, NDFI, SHADE] both t0 and t1
